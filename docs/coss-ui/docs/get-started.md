This guide provides the essentials for adding **coss ui** components to your React application.

## Prerequisites

Our components are built with [Tailwind CSS v4](https://tailwindcss.com). Before you begin, make sure you have a React project set up with Tailwind CSS.

## Adding Components

You can add components **automatically with the shadcn CLI** or **manually by copying the files**. Both methods work for primitives, particles, and atoms.

### With the CLI

Each component page provides a command to add it to your project automatically. The CLI will create the necessary files and install any dependencies for you.

### New Project Setup (Recommended)

For new projects, use the **coss style** preset to initialize everything in one command:

```bash
npx shadcn@latest init @coss/style
```

This installs all UI components, the neutral color system, sidebar variables, and base styles. It also installs **Inter** (`--font-sans`, `--font-heading`) and **Geist Mono** (`--font-mono`) as default fonts, automatically configured in your `layout.tsx`.

### Existing Projects

To add components to an existing project:

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add @coss/ui
```

This adds all UI primitives (button, card, avatar, dialog, tabs, and more). For the full theme including colors, sidebar, and fonts:

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add @coss/style
```

Or add only the color tokens:

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add @coss/ui @coss/colors-neutral
```

See the [Styling](https://coss.com/ui/docs/styling) guide for more details.

### Manually

1.  **Find a component** on the [Components](/docs/coss-ui/docs/index.md) or [Particles](https://coss.com/ui/particles) pages.
2.  **Copy the code** from the **Code** tab.
3.  **Create a new file** in your project (e.g., `components/ui/button.tsx`) and paste the code.
4.  **Install any dependencies** listed on the component's page.
5.  **Import and use** the component in your app.

## Styling

Components are styled with the design token system we use at **Cal.com**, which is defined by CSS variables and implemented with Tailwind CSS.

The variables are the same as shadcn/ui, and are fully customizable. You can modify them in your global stylesheet (e.g., `app/globals.css`) to match your design system.

We've introduced a few additional tokens to provide more granular control:

- `--destructive-foreground`: Used for destructive-outline buttons, destructive menu items, badges, and field errors
- `--info` and `--info-foreground`: Commonly used for info-colored badges, toast types, and alerts
- `--success` and `--success-foreground`: Used for success-colored badges, toast types, and alerts
- `--warning` and `--warning-foreground`: Used for warning-colored badges, toast types, and alerts

**Important**: If you manually import components, you must also import these additional tokens in your CSS file (e.g., `app/globals.css`). However, if you use the CLI to import components, these tokens will be automatically imported and configured for you.

## Fonts

coss components use three CSS custom properties for typography:

- `--font-sans` — Body text, buttons, labels, and most UI elements
- `--font-mono` — Code blocks, `<kbd>`, monospace text
- `--font-heading` — Dialog and AlertDialog titles (`--font-heading: var(--font-sans)` in theme)

When you use `@coss/style`, `@coss/fonts` is installed automatically — Inter for `--font-sans` and `--font-heading`, Geist Mono for `--font-mono` — all wired in your `layout.tsx`.

coss.com uses **Cal Sans 2.0** variable from `@coss/ui/fonts` for both body and headings. By default the theme aliases `--font-heading` to `--font-sans`, so one `--font-sans` variable is enough. You can wire a separate `--font-heading` when titles should use a different family — see [Styling — Font Variables](https://coss.com/ui/docs/styling#font-variables).

### Custom fonts

To use different fonts, ensure the `variable` option in your `next/font` configuration matches the expected CSS variables:

```tsx
import { Inter } from "next/font/google";
import { JetBrains_Mono } from "next/font/google";

const inter = Inter({ variable: "--font-sans", subsets: ["latin"] });
const jetbrainsMono = JetBrains_Mono({ variable: "--font-mono", subsets: ["latin"] });
```

When sans and heading share one family, only `--font-sans` needs to be set — the theme aliases `--font-heading` to it.

For a separate heading font, add `--font-heading` in your layout and update the theme token:

```tsx
const interDisplay = Inter({ variable: "--font-heading", subsets: ["latin"], weight: "700" });

<body className={`${inter.variable} ${interDisplay.variable} ${jetbrainsMono.variable} font-sans`}>
```

```css
@theme inline {
  --font-heading: var(--font-heading);
}
```

**Note:** Next.js starters default to variable names like `--font-geist-sans`, which don't match coss's expected `--font-sans`. If fonts appear broken after setup, check that the variable names match.

## Primitive exports

Components that wrap Base UI primitives re-export the underlying primitive. Use the styled component when our defaults work, or the primitive when you need different compositions or styling. In a monorepo with a shared UI package, apps import from that package—Base UI stays in one place, no need to add it to each app.

```tsx
import { Slider, SliderValue, SliderPrimitive } from "@coss/ui/components/slider";
```

## Base UI Re-exports

When you only need `useRender`, `mergeProps`, `CSPProvider`, or `DirectionProvider`, import them from `@coss/ui/base-ui/*` instead of adding `@base-ui/react` as a direct dependency:

- `@coss/ui/base-ui/use-render`
- `@coss/ui/base-ui/merge-props`
- `@coss/ui/base-ui/csp-provider`
- `@coss/ui/base-ui/direction-provider`

This is especially useful in **monorepos**: apps and packages that already depend on `@coss/ui` can use these utilities without adding `@base-ui/react` as another dependency. You avoid duplicate installs, keep versions in sync, and simplify your dependency tree—`@base-ui/react` lives in one place (`@coss/ui`), and everything else imports through it.

## Migration from Radix UI

For developers migrating from **Radix UI**, many of our **UI primitives** include instructions and examples for translating equivalent Radix components to Base UI. This ensures a smooth transition while preserving accessibility, behaviors, and API patterns.

## Working with LLMs

We structure the documentation to make the components **AI-friendly**, so language models can understand, reason about, and modify them. To support this, we include:

- **[Agent Skills](https://coss.com/ui/docs/skills)** — Install coss knowledge directly into your AI assistant with `npx skills add cosscom/coss`. Covers all 53 primitives, styling conventions, migration patterns, and particle examples.
- A [llms.txt](/docs/coss-ui/llms.txt) file that provides a map of the documentation and component structure for your AI agent.
- A **Copy Markdown** button on every page, so you can easily share content or feed it to your AI workflows.
